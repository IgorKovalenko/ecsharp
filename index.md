# About Loyc

The Language of Your Choice (Loyc) project is intended to become a rich set of tools for:

- Transforming source code between different languages
- Writing libraries (or entire programs) in multiple programming languages
- IDEs (code completion lists, various kinds of code visualization, intellisense)
- Code analysis and transformation

Enhanced C#, LES (Loyc Expression Syntax) and LEL (Loyc expression langauge) are also under the Loyc umbrella.

This is a huge project with many parts and I am looking feverishly for volunteers to create these parts.
