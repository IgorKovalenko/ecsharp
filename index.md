# About Loyc

The Language of Your Choice (Loyc) project is intended to become a rich set of tools for:

- Transforming source code between different languages
- Writing libraries (or entire programs) in multiple programming languages
- IDEs (code completion lists, various kinds of code visualization, intellisense)
- Code analysis and transformation

Enhanced C#, LES (Loyc Expression Syntax) and LEL (Loyc expression langauge) are also under the Loyc umbrella.

It is in very early stages right now because I have not found anyone else with whom to work on it. I am focusing on the first point right now (transforming code between languages). Also, LES is working and I'm busy developing early stages of LeMP and Enhanced C#. The project also currently includes a set of general-purpose libraries that will eventually be spun off into a separate project for a multi-language standard library.
