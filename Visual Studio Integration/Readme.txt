These solutions build Visual Studio extensions.

- with the exception of single-file generators (see http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/686405/Writing-a-Single-File-Generator), Visual Studio extensions can only be built by the exact version of Visual Studio they were designed for, e.g. a VS2010 extension can only be built by VS2010. If you know a workaround, I'd like to hear it!
- They require a professional (non-Express) version of Visual Studio
- They require the matching Visual Studio SDK. Note that VS2010 SP1 requires the VS2010 SP1 SDK; the VS2010 SDK will not work in VS 2010 SP1.
