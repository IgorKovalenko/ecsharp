1. Performance is important. Wasm code should, at the limit, run as fast as C [could be faster, but it doesn't matter.]
2. It should contain a variety of flexible primitives so that the core features of all known languages can be supported somewhat efficiently. In addition to opcodes, I'm talking about design issues like garbage collection, how pointers interact with GC (e.g. the .NET rules are too limiting), "sub-sandboxing", and metaprogramming features at the JIT level, whether it be replacing code at run-time or injecting profiling instructions.
3. Interoperability between programming languages should be a core focus, and a multi-language standard library should be defined so that different languages can exchange complex data structures with ease.
4. Traditionally, client code on the web has been open-source. Let's not threaten this tradition. Wasm binaries should be rich in metadata by default, so that it can be decompiled to existing programming languages, complete with documentation. Obfuscation should be opt-in, not opt-out. Incidentally, third parties will use this as a means of converting code between languages.
