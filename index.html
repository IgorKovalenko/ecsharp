<p>Please visit the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/loyc/?source=navbar">Main Documentation</a> (doc comments available upon request) or the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/loyc/">SourceForge project page</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>Language of Your Choice (Loyc)</b> project is intended to become a rich set of tools for:
</p>
<ul><li> Transforming source code between different languages
</li><li> Cross-language library programming, also known as acmeism
</li><li> IDEs (code completion lists, various kinds of code visualization, intellisense)
</li><li> Code analysis and transformation
</li></ul>
<p>Initially it will run on .NET, although I hope it will spread to the land of native code someday. The foundations are written in C#, which will eventually become Enhanced C#.
</p><p>Enhanced C#, LES (Loyc Expression Syntax) and LEL (Loyc expression langauge) are also under the Loyc umbrella.
