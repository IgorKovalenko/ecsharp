LLLPG is a recursive-decent parser generator for C#, with a feature set better than ANTLR version 2. It's one of the only parser generators designed for _coders_: it generates clean, straightforward code, only slightly uglier than you would write by hand, and it's convenient for small parsing tasks, not just big ones.

To learn more, [read the FAQ](faq.html) or the five-part article series about LLLPG:

- [Part 1](lllpg-part-1.html)
- [Part 2](lllpg-part-2.html)
- [Part 3](lllpg-part-3.html)
- [Part 4](lllpg-part-4.html)
- [Part 5](lllpg-part-5.html)

### Download & install ###

LLLPG is distributed with LeMP and Enhanced C#; please see their [download & installation instructons](http://ecsharp.net/lemp/install.html). Also, please download the [Samples repository](http://github.com/qwertie/LLLPG-Samples) so you'll have some grammars to play with; these demos should compile successfully even before LLLPG is installed.
