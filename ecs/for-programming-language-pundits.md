This is an article series for people that like to learn about programming languages. It is especially recommended if you're interested in adding features to Enhanced C#, either by writing macros or by helping to make the compiler. Everyone else should read the [article for normal coders](for-normal-coders.html).

Note: the following is a draft. It is not complete and it is not up-to-date.
