Now that LeMP has a compelling library of standard macros for C#...

- The `replace` macro a.k.a. "a `#define` for C#"
- `unroll`, the simple and handy code generator
- The `SetOrCreateMember` macro that helps you create new data types really quickly
- Algebraic Data Types aka Disjoint unions
- Pattern matching of data structures
- Pattern matching of code
- Code quotes
- A clone of D's `scope(failure)` & `scope(exit)`
- And more

I've been writing articles about these features, plus a new [LeMP Home Page](/lemp). Enjoy!
