After living on CodeProject for a couple of years, it's past time to unveil the new [LLLPG home page](/lllpg).

And now that LeMP has a compelling library of standard macros for C#...

- The `replace` macro a.k.a. "C# gets its own `#define`"
- `unroll`, the simple and handy code generator
- The `SetOrCreateMember` macro that helps you create new data types really quickly
- Algebraic Data Types aka Disjoint unions
- Pattern matching of data structures
- Pattern matching of code
- Code quotes
- A clone of D's `scope(failure)` & `scope(exit)`
- And more

I've been writing articles about these features, and added a new [LeMP Home Page](/lemp) to tie everything together. Enjoy! Maybe it's a bit OCD but I also put together a version history for [LLLPG](http://loyc.net/lllpg/version-history.html), [LeMP](http://loyc.net/lemp/version-history.html) and [for the Core Libraries](http://core.loyc.net/version-history).
